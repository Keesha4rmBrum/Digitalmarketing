## What I learned
I learned how to change font sizes with css. I learned how to change the sizes of images with pixels. I learned how to clone, commit and pull code. 

## Problems
I played with the header size and was unable to successfully troubleshoot the problem I created where the header at the top of the page became too short and did not align with the image below it.
